# 📈 03. Usage Data Analysis & Strategic Reporting

This directory documents the executive protocol for utilizing **vendor-provided dashboards** (e.g., MagicSchool AI Advanced Data Dashboards) to translate raw usage metrics into actionable strategic decisions regarding platform ROI, professional development needs, and scaling strategies.

## Data Tool Validation
This protocol demonstrates expertise in **Data Analytics and Executive Interpretation**, proving the ability to derive strategic insights directly from complex platform dashboards.

## Protocol Focus: ROI & Adoption Trends
The goal is to translate quantitative usage data into a compelling executive narrative for the district board.

### Key Analysis Steps

1.  **Metric Selection:** Identify the 3-5 key metrics from the MagicSchool dashboard that correlate most directly with time savings (e.g., Generations per Active User).
2.  **Trend Interpretation:** Analyze the trend lines for **Active User Cohort Retention** (Are users still active after 60 days?) and **Tool Efficacy** (Which tools are used most?).
3.  **Visualization:** (No external tool needed) Document the required visuals (e.g., Line Chart for Retention) that must be captured from the dashboard.
4.  **Strategic Conclusion:** Generate a Board-level summary detailing whether the platform is meeting its efficiency and adoption targets, citing the dashboard data as evidence.
