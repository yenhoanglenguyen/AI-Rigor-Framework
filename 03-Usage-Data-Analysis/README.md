# 📈 03. Usage Data Analysis & Strategic Reporting

This directory documents the executive protocol for extracting and analyzing **system-level usage data** (e.g., from the MagicSchool AI dashboard) to inform executive decisions regarding platform ROI, professional development needs, and future scaling strategies.

## Data Tool Validation
This protocol demonstrates the direct application of expertise in **Data Analytics, Strategic Reporting, and Visualization (PowerBI / Tableau)** to large-scale usage datasets.

## Protocol Focus: ROI & Adoption Trends
The goal is to translate quantitative usage data into actionable strategic recommendations for the district board.

### Key Analysis Steps

1.  **Data Extraction:** Export aggregated usage data (Generations by User/Tool/Time) from the MagicSchool Admin Dashboard.
2.  **Cleaning & Modeling:** Use standard tools (e.g., SQL or Pandas) to clean, normalize, and structure the data into a star schema for visualization.
3.  **Visualization (PowerBI/Tableau):** Create key executive dashboards focusing on:
    * **Cohort Retention:** Are users generating content after 30/60/90 days? (Measures long-term utility).
    * **ROI by Tool:** Which tools drive the highest volume (e.g., Lesson Planner vs. Rubric Generator)? (Informs resource allocation).
4.  **Strategic Conclusion:** Generate a Board-level summary detailing whether the platform is meeting its efficiency and adoption targets.
