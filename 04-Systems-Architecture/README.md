# ⚙️ 04. Systems Architecture & Logical Design

This directory documents the application of formal **Engineering Design Principles** (precision, constraint management, conditional flow control) to the architecture and functional logic of custom EdTech and AI tools.

## Transferable Skill: Engineering Logic
The meticulous focus on logical sequencing and constraint management required for complex physical design is applied here to define the robust workflow for software tools, ensuring precision and minimizing failure points.

## Project Focus: Adaptive Assessment System
We document the high-level conditional logic for an adaptive assessment system. This is the crucial foundational blueprint that a development team would follow to build the product.

## Key Design Principles
* **Logic Flow Control:** Defining IF/THEN/ELSE branching logic to guide user experience and prevent dead ends.
* **Constraint Management:** Specifying mandatory performance thresholds before the system allows student advancement.
* **System Integrity:** Designing the architecture to ensure every input leads to a defined, measurable output.
