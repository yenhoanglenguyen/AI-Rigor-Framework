**Associated Prompt Chain:** [Link to H-TESS-Evaluation-V1.txt]
**Evaluation Date:** 2025-11-08
**Evaluator:** [Your Initials or Team Role]

## Metric Rubric (Scale: 1 [Ineffective] - 5 [Highly Effective])

| Metric Category | Criteria | Score | Notes/Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fidelity** | **Adherence to H-TESS Structure/Protocol** | 5 | Successfully followed all sequential steps and mandatory pause points. |
| **Rigor** | **Verbatim/Time-Stamped Evidence Extraction** | 5 | Crucial feature successfully implemented, providing verifiable data (the "scientific evidence"). |
| **Logic** | **Scoring and Rationale (Rule-Based)** | 5 | Correctly applied IF/THEN logic (If Ineffective Attribute selected, then score is Ineffective). |
| **Pedagogy** | **Integration of Research-Based Practices** | 4 | Recommendations successfully integrated TLAC/Retrieval Practice, but need wider variety (e.g., Explicit Instruction). |
| **Efficiency** | **Time Saved (Manual vs. AI)** | 5 | Full evaluation cycle reduced from 4 hours (human) to <10 minutes (AI). |

## Strategic Conclusion

This prompt is validated as a high-impact automation tool. The design successfully integrates **rule-based logic** and **verifiable evidence extraction** (Time-Stamping), which directly supports the district's need for objective, data-driven teacher evaluation. The prompt is ready for pilot deployment.
