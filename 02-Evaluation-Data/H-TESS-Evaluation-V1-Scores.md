## 1. Score Fidelity: AI vs. Human Control

The following table compares the AI's autonomous score determination (based on the provided rubric logic) against a certified human administrator's score (the Control Baseline) for the same lesson transcript.

| H-TESS Component | Human Control Score | AI Tool Output Score | Fidelity (Match?) | Rationale (High-Level) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1c: Outcomes** | 3 (Proficient) | 3 (Proficient) | **YES** | Clear alignment of AI's evidence with human finding. |
| **2c: Management** | 4 (Highly Effective) | 3 (Proficient) | **NO** | AI missed key evidence points related to proactive management strategies. |
| **2d: Analysis** | 3 (Proficient) | 3 (Proficient) | **YES** | Perfect score match. |
| **3b: Activities** | 2 (Emerging) | 2 (Emerging) | **YES** | AI correctly identified the lack of rigor in the activities. |
| **3c: Questioning** | 3 (Proficient) | 3 (Proficient) | **YES** | Perfect score match. |
| **3d: Feedback** | 4 (Highly Effective) | 4 (Highly Effective) | **YES** | Perfect score match. |

**Score Fidelity Rate:** 5 out of 6 Components Matched = **83% Accuracy**

## 2. Evidence Rigor and Utility Metrics

| Metric Category | Findings | Executive Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rigor (Verifiable Evidence)** | The AI successfully extracted **time-stamped, verbatim quotes** for all 6 components, providing a strong, objective evidence trail. | **100% Evidence Integrity.** The tool ensures all scores are fully justifiable. |
| **Logic (Rationale Match)** | The AI successfully pulled the **EXACT rubric text blocks** to justify its scores, validating the prompt's rule-based logic. | **100% Logic Compliance.** The tool cannot "hallucinate" rationale. |
| **Utility (Recommendations)** | Recommendations were specific and integrated research-based strategies (e.g., TLAC, Retrieval Practice), showing high pedagogical value. | **High Actionability.** Output is immediately useful for instructional coaching. |

## 🚀 Strategic Conclusion

The H-TESS Evaluation Tool achieved an **83% score fidelity** with the human control, demonstrating it is highly effective as a **quality assurance and efficiency tool**. The system's strength lies in its **rigorous evidence extraction** and **rule-based logic**, making it ready for pilot deployment in district coaching cycles.
