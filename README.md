# 🚀 AI Evaluation Rigor Framework: Ensuring Pedagogical Alignment in LLM Outputs

This repository documents the foundational **methodology and metric structure** used to evaluate Generative AI tools (LLMs) before district-wide adoption. The framework translates scientific **experimental design** principles into practical, scalable criteria for educational utility and equity.

## Context and Problem
In K-12 education, LLMs often produce outputs that lack **pedagogical fidelity** or reinforce bias. The objective of this framework is to introduce **scientific rigor** into the evaluation pipeline, ensuring all adopted GenAI tools actively **support High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM)** standards and measure effectiveness against defined learning goals.

## Key Framework Pillars
1.  **Prompt Design Rigor:** Standardization of prompt engineering to test LLM behavior under controlled conditions.
2.  **Output Validation:** Establishing quantitative and qualitative metrics for measuring output utility.
3.  **Equity and Bias Assessment:** Systematic testing for bias across various demographic and cultural contexts.
